# Returance Menu Managing System

To run the program, navigate to src >> Java Program >> Welcome.java
The cusine folder is the database. However, it can be deleted and a new database can be created by running InstallDb.java.
The program was made in Netbean with Database library installed. Therefore, it is better using the existing database. 

To run the program use:
```
javac *.java
```
to run and run Welcome.java class to run the command: 
```
java Welcome.java
```

Navigation: When run the program, at the upper left of the frame, there is a help button that showcase and explain the funcnality of all the features in the program.

Warning: If the there is no table presented in the program. That means the database is not set up correctly, steps to set up database in NetBean is needed. Future implementation of server database would remove this issue.
